READMEJames CrawfordComputational AssignmentTo invoke the code to produce the results, simply run each file and all the labeled results will appear. In some cases such as 5 there are cells, however running the whole file for each will work regardless. Spyder was used.In general functions were used, and everything was kept as general as possible such that it has applications outside the questions asked. Python was chosen since while its matrix environment is less specialised, it provides lots of freedom to combine the results obtained with other broader applications.
